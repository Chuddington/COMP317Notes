Notes: 
- As these are audio files and last ~50 minutes each, they have not been
  downloaded into the repository for now, unless I change their file format into
  something a little more manageable (.ogg, maybe).  Instead, the direct link to
  the audio files have been given below, avoiding the Lecturer's site
  ( http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~grant/Teaching/COMP317/Lectures/lectures.html )
  which may be out of date, or the University's streaming service 
  (https://stream.liv.ac.uk/users/grant) as both use a flash player which hides
  the url from the listener, so you cannot download them.
- As of this writing (11/04/2016), The first recording available from the
  Lecturer's site is Lecture 10, but there are earlier recordings for this
  Module available on the University streaming service.  I am therefore
  guessing that the previous two recordings are for the previous lectures
  (7-8 and 9).
